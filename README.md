# Mongoid::Scribe
[WIP] Mongoid Scribe stores MongoDB explain output, per request, to flag Mongoid queries in need of optimization. The intention is to allow developers to quickly check if any model indexes are required for a Rails app controller action.

## Usage
TBD

## Installation
TBD
<!--Add this line to your application's Gemfile:-->

<!--```ruby-->
<!--gem 'mongoid-scribe'-->
<!--```-->

<!--And then execute:-->
<!--```bash-->
<!--$ bundle-->
<!--```-->

<!--Or install it yourself as:-->
<!--```bash-->
<!--$ gem install mongoid-scribe-->
<!--```-->
